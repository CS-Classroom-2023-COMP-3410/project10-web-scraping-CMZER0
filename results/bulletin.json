            "description": "The course introduces fundamentals of probability for data science. Students survey data visualization methods and summary statistics, develop models for data, and apply statistical techniques to assess the validity of the models. The techniques will include parametric and nonparametric methods for parameter estimation and hypothesis testing for a single sample mean and two sample means, for proportions, and for simple linear regression. Students will acquire sound theoretical footing for the methods where practical, and will apply them to real-world data, primarily using R."
